# Elevate_Health_Analysis
Founded in 2016, Elevate Health is a medical insurance company that serves thousands of customers throughout the United States. In 2019, they launched a new set of marketing campaign categories spanning topics such as wellness tips, plan affordability, and preventative care. Elevate Health customers can sign up for 4 different plans: bronze, silver, gold, and platiunum, each with different premiums and claim coverage rates.

Elevate Health has hired a new data team to assist them in strategizing their marketing budget for the year. The company aims to build a more robust understanding of these campaign categories and how they relate to signups and subsqeutent patient claims.

As a data analyst contracting with Elevate Health, this analysis will be hinged on providing a dynamic visual deliverable to enable the marketing team to self-serve insights and regular-cadence reporting.
